Visiting Spain and Portugal in December can be a great experience, depending on what you’re looking for in a trip! Here’s a breakdown of what to expect:

### Weather:
- **Spain**:
  - **Southern Spain** (e.g., Seville, Granada, Malaga): Mild to cool temperatures, ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F). It's generally pleasant, with plenty of sunshine, making it a great time for sightseeing without the crowds.
  - **Central Spain** (e.g., Madrid): Cooler temperatures, around 5°C to 15°C (41°F to 59°F). It can get quite chilly, especially at night. Snow is possible in higher-altitude regions.
  - **Northern Spain** (e.g., Bilbao, Santiago de Compostela): Much cooler, with temperatures between 5°C and 12°C (41°F to 54°F), and it can be rainy.
  
- **Portugal**:
  - **Lisbon and the Southern Algarve**: Mild weather, usually between 10°C and 18°C (50°F to 64°F). It’s a good time to visit the beaches, though it might be too cold for swimming.
  - **Porto and the Northern Region**: Cooler, with temperatures ranging from 5°C to 15°C (41°F to 59°F) and some rainy days. Porto can be atmospheric during the holiday season with beautiful lights.

### Crowds and Prices:
- **Off-Peak Season**: December is outside of the usual tourist season, except for the holiday period around Christmas and New Year. This means lower prices for accommodation and flights.
- **Christmas Markets**: In Spain and Portugal, you’ll find charming Christmas markets, especially in cities like Madrid, Seville, and Lisbon. It’s a festive time to enjoy local traditions, food, and decorations.

### Activities:
- **Cultural Experiences**: It’s a great time to explore museums, historical sites, and local festivals without the summer crowds.
- **Holiday Festivities**: Both countries have rich traditions during the Christmas season. For example, you can experience Spanish "Navidad" celebrations or Portuguese "Natal," including unique local foods and celebrations.
- **Nature & Outdoors**: Hiking and exploring nature might be best in the southern parts due to milder weather. In Northern areas, you'll want to be prepared for potential rain.

### Overall:
If you enjoy cooler weather, want to explore cities and cultural sites, and don't mind a more relaxed and quieter atmosphere, visiting Spain and Portugal in December is an excellent idea. It’s less ideal if you’re hoping for beach weather and warm temperatures, but the charm of the holiday season makes up for it!
