As a Chinese passport holder with a U.S. Green Card, you are exempt from obtaining a visa to enter Costa Rica for tourism purposes. This exemption allows you to stay in Costa Rica for up to 30 days. 

**Entry Requirements:**

- **Passport Validity**: Your Chinese passport must be valid for at least six months from your date of entry into Costa Rica. 

- **U.S. Green Card Validity**: Your U.S. Green Card must be valid for at least six months from your date of entry into Costa Rica. 

- **Return or Onward Ticket**: You must have a return ticket to your country of origin or a ticket for onward travel to another destination. 

- **Proof of Economic Means**: You should be able to demonstrate that you have at least US$100.00 for each month or partial month of your intended stay in Costa Rica. 

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Immigration Officer's Discretion**: While the visa exemption applies, the final decision on entry and the length of stay is at the discretion of the immigration officer upon arrival. 

- **Extension of Stay**: If you wish to stay longer than 30 days, you must apply for an extension at the Office of Migration in Costa Rica. 

For the most current information, it's advisable to consult the official website of the Costa Rican Embassy or the U.S. Department of State before your trip.
