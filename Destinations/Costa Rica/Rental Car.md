Using rental cars for a trip that includes both Costa Rica and Panama can be a bit tricky due to border-crossing restrictions, but it’s possible with some planning. Here’s how it could work:

---

### **Rental Car Logistics**
1. **Cross-Border Driving Restrictions:**
   - Most rental car companies in Costa Rica and Panama **do not allow cross-border driving**. However, some companies (e.g., **Alamo**) offer services to facilitate border crossings:
     - You drive the rental car to the border and drop it off.
     - A new rental car is provided on the other side of the border.

2. **Rental Company Options:**
   - **Alamo Rent a Car:** Offers a "vehicle exchange service" at border crossings (e.g., Paso Canoas). You must arrange this service in advance.
   - **Adobe Rent a Car:** Allows drop-off at the border in Costa Rica and pick-up on the Panama side, but the two rentals are treated as separate agreements.

3. **Border Crossings:**
   - The most convenient crossings for rental car travel are **Paso Canoas** (Pacific side) or **Sixaola-Guabito** (Caribbean side, near Bocas del Toro).
   - Border formalities for the car are managed by rental company representatives, if applicable.

### **Cost Considerations**
- **Rental Fees:** You will likely pay for two separate rentals (one in Costa Rica and one in Panama). This might include:
  - A one-way drop-off fee for the car left at the border.
  - A new rental fee in the second country.
- **Insurance:** Ensure that you understand the insurance requirements and coverage in both countries, as policies may differ.
- **Border Fees:** Both Costa Rica and Panama charge small exit/entry fees at their borders. These are typically paid in cash.

### **Driving Tips**
1. **Documentation Required:**
   - Valid driver's license (your U.S. license is sufficient for short stays).
   - Passport and U.S. Green Card for border crossing.
   - Rental car documentation (provided by the rental company).

2. **Road Conditions:**
   - Roads in Costa Rica are generally good in popular areas, but rural roads can be rough or unpaved.
   - Panama’s roads are well-maintained in most areas, especially between major cities and tourist destinations.

3. **Navigation:**
   - Use GPS or a navigation app (e.g., Google Maps or Waze). Offline maps are recommended for areas with spotty cell service.
