Good question. Here’s **how to book a private transfer** from New Chitose Airport (CTS) → Niseko — and what you need to know to get it done easily.

## ✅ What are “private transfers”

A “private transfer” means a booked car or van (not a public bus) that picks you up at the airport arrival lobby and drives you **directly to your hotel or chalet in Niseko** — no bus-schedule constraints. ([English][1])
This is especially good if you land late (like your 17:20 arrival) — many public buses don’t run late enough, but private transfers can often accommodate late arrivals. ([Mik Taxi Sapporo][2])

## 📝 How to Book (step-by-step)

1. **Choose a provider** (see above) — pick based on group size, budget, and drop-off location.
2. **Go online or contact them** — many have English-friendly websites and allow online bookings (enter flight arrival time, number of people, luggage / ski bags, destination hotel).
3. **Provide flight & arrival info** — input your arrival time (e.g. 17:20), flight number, number of passengers, luggage/gear.
4. **Select vehicle type** — for example a sedan for 1–3 people, a van for groups, or a minibus for larger parties.
5. **Confirm & pay** — most services allow online payment (credit / debit), and will send confirmation with driver details.
6. **Meet & greet at arrival** — on the day, driver will wait at airport arrival hall (often holding your name on a sign), help with luggage, then take you directly to Niseko. ([Viator][6])

## 💡 What to Check When Booking

* **Vehicle capacity & luggage / ski-gear allowances**: If you have skis / snowboards / big luggage, make sure vehicle is suitable.
* **Weather / road-condition readiness**: Winter driving in Hokkaido may involve snow; choose providers experienced in winter roads (e.g. SkyExpress, Mik-Taxi). ([Mik Taxi Sapporo][2])
* **Pickup time flexibility**: Ensure they monitor flight delays and adjust pickup accordingly — many providers do. ([Mik Taxi Sapporo][2])
* **Destination drop-off**: Confirm they drop you directly at your accommodation (not just a bus-station in Niseko).
* **Cost**: Private transfers are more expensive than public buses — but worth it for convenience and late arrivals. Depending on group / season / vehicle, typical one-way private transfer fares from Chitose → Niseko vary. ([Niseko Central][3])
