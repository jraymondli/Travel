## ‚úÖ Will you be able to use a lounge at 19:55 departure?

Given the IASS Executive Lounge 1 is open until **21:00**, you have time to use it before your flight at 19:55. ([IASS][2])
Because your flight is later in the evening, if you‚Äôre early, that lounge is likely your best bet.

**Important note**: Since IASS is before security, once you pass immigration & security you may not have lounge options beyond the airside ones, unless your airline or status grants access to airline lounges past security. Check your boarding gate area for airline lounges (for your airline or alliance) post-security.
