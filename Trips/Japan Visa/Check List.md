That’s a smart question — the **Consulate-General of Japan in San Francisco** gives guidance on this.

✅ **You and your wife should send everything together in one package**, because:

* The Consulate asks that **family members applying together** place all applications in **one envelope**. This makes processing smoother and ensures your passports are mailed back together.
* You only need **one prepaid USPS return envelope** (Priority Mail / Priority Express with tracking) that is large enough for **both passports**.
* Inside the package, just keep each person’s application materials **neatly separated** (e.g., each in its own clear folder), but mailed together in the same outer envelope.

⚠️ Important notes:

* **Do not staple or clip** documents — they specifically request paper submissions be loose.
* Be sure to include a **separate completed visa application form, photo, green card copy, and supporting docs for each applicant**.
* If one of you is the “main applicant” (e.g., you’re requesting a multiple-entry visa and your wife is applying as a spouse), make sure both applications clearly state your relationship (marriage certificate copy may help if asked).

📦 **Package Checklist for 2 Applicants (one envelope):**

* Passport for each person
* Completed visa application form (one each)
* One passport-size photo each
* Copy of each U.S. green card
* Itinerary and Multiple-Entry Visa Request Form(s)
* Proof of funds / other supporting docs (can be shared if joint finances)
* One **prepaid USPS return envelope** with tracking (large enough for 2 passports)

👉 So yes, **send one package together with one return envelope** — just keep each person’s set of documents separated inside.

Do you want me to draft you a **cover letter template** that lists both applicants’ names and passports, so the consulate processes them as a family group? That often helps.
