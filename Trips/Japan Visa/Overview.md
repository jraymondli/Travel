Great — thanks for clarifying your location and travel background. Since you live in the **San Francisco Bay Area**, you fall under the jurisdiction of the **Consulate-General of Japan in San Francisco**. Here’s what applies to you:

---

## 1. Where to Apply

* **Consulate-General of Japan in San Francisco**
  275 Battery Street, Suite 2100
  San Francisco, CA 94111
  Phone: (415) 780-6000
  Website: [Consulate General of Japan in San Francisco – Visa](https://www.sf.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/visa.html)

You will submit your application directly to this consulate (no VFS in the U.S.).

## 2. Multiple-Entry Visa for Sightseeing

Japan does issue **multiple-entry short-term stay visas** for U.S. residents in certain circumstances, but they are not automatic. For sightseeing purposes, issuance depends on your:

* **Travel history** (you’ve been twice in the past 2 years — that helps).
* **Purpose** (you state repeated sightseeing visits).
* **Financial stability** (proof you can support repeated trips).

---

## 3. Documents You’ll Likely Need

From the San Francisco consulate’s guidance:

* **Valid Passport** (must have blank visa pages, and be valid beyond intended stay).
* **Visa Application Form** (available on the consulate website, signed, with 1 recent photo attached).
* **Proof of Residence** in their jurisdiction (California, except southern counties; Nevada).
* **Travel Itinerary** (planned entry/exit dates, accommodation info, sightseeing outline).
* **Proof of Financial Ability** (recent bank statements, tax return, or employment verification).
* **Cover Letter** stating:

  * Why you are applying for a multiple-entry visa
  * Travel history to Japan (mention your past 2 visits)
  * Your future plans (repeated tourism/sightseeing trips)

*(Some applicants are issued a single-entry visa first; if you have multiple past visits, you may qualify directly for multiple-entry.)*

---

## 4. Validity & Conditions

* **Typical Validity**: 1–5 years (most often 3 years), with **stay up to 90 days per visit**.
* **Entry Purpose**: Tourism/sightseeing only (cannot work).

---

## 5. Application Process

1. **Complete the form** and prepare all supporting documents.
2. **Submit in person** (or via proxy with authorization) at the SF consulate.
3. **Processing Time**: Usually \~5 business days, but longer if additional review is needed.
4. **Pickup**: Visa is affixed in your passport upon approval.

✅ **Tip:** In your cover letter, emphasize:

* Your genuine interest in Japanese culture and sightseeing,
* Your frequent past travel (twice in 2 years),
* Your plan to continue visiting Japan as a repeat tourist.
