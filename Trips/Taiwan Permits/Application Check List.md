Here’s a **tailored checklist** for you and your wife (Chinese passports + U.S. green cards, applying for Taiwan entry permit for tourism):

---

## ✅ Application Checklist

1. **PRC Passport**

   * Must be valid for at least **6 months** beyond your travel dates.

2. **U.S. Green Card**

   * Clear scan/copy (front and back).
   * Serves as proof of permanent residency abroad.

3. **Recent Photo**

   * One **2-inch color photo**, white background, front-facing, no hat or tinted glasses.
   * Taken within the last 2 years.
   * Size: 4.5 cm (height) × 3.5 cm (width), with head length 3.2–3.6 cm.
   * You’ll upload this in the online application system.

4. **Application Form (online)**

   * Fill out via the Ministry of the Interior’s **境外人士線上申辦系統**:
     👉 [Online Application Portal](https://coa.immigration.gov.tw/coa-frontend/overseas-foreign-china)
   * No need to print; all submission is electronic.

5. **Fee Payment**

   * NT\$600 (≈ USD 19–20) per person.
   * Paid online by credit card **after approval**.

6. **Approval & Download**

   * After approval (usually 3–5 business days), log in again and download/print your **Entry & Exit Permit**.

## 📌 What You Don’t Need at Application Time

* No flight booking required at the time of online application.
* No hotel reservation required at the time of online application.
* No bank statements needed (you qualify through your green card).

---

## ✈️ What You Must Carry When Traveling

* Printed **Entry & Exit Permit**.
* **Passport + Green Card**.
* **Return or onward ticket** (airline will check at boarding, and immigration will check at arrival).
* Hotel booking (not mandatory at application, but sometimes immigration asks where you’ll stay — better to have proof ready).

✅ With just your passport, green card, photo, and online form, you and your wife can apply. The **return flight ticket only matters at travel time**, not application.

Would you like me to also draft a **suggested timeline** for when you and your wife should submit, pay, and download to be perfectly covered for your **Dec 17–23 trip**?
